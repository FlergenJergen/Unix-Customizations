## Branch for Ubuntu-VMs

 Mostly here for my sake, so I have an easy
 way to get things back to the way I prefer.
 That said, making it public for friends and
 anyone else that wants to give them a try.
 Pull requests welcome if you find some cool
 tricks or different ways of doing things.

## Currently Included:
 -  .bashrc
 - .vimrc
 -  some scripting tools I like
 -  scripts to do apt stuff I always do with
        new VMs
 
 master-script currently broken. Look at it 
    for reference if you want. Need to clean
    up the way it calls scripts from dirs. No 
    one uses this besides me though, so not a 
    high priority.
