# Unix-Customizations

 Mostly here for my sake, so I have an easy

 That said, making it public for friends and
 anyone else that wants to give them a try.
 Pull requests welcome if you find some cool
 tricks or different ways of doing things.

## Currently Included:
   .bashrc
   .vimrc
 
 Copy them to user's home folder to give them 
 a try. I highly recommend making backups of 
 your current configuration first.
